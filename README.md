## This project utilizes Flask and JSON to display real-time ISS location data. The information is retrieved from the Open Notify API (http://api.open-notify.org) and shown on the website. In addition to the ISS location, the project also presents weather data of the country situated directly beneath the space station. Weather information is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://api.openweathermap.org), while country data is sourced from the Rest Countries API (https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all)
